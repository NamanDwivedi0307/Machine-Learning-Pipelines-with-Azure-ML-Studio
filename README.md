# Machine-Learning-Pipelines-with-Azure-ML-Studio.# 🚀 Income Prediction with Boosted Decision Trees on Azure ML Studio

This project demonstrates how to build a **complete ML pipeline** on **Microsoft Azure ML Studio**, using the **Adult Income Census** dataset. The goal is to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000/year based on attributes like age, education, and occupation using a **Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree Classifier** — all **without writing code**.
